# Doctor Consultation with Artificial Intelligence.

*Release:  **April 2024***

Hello everyone,  the purpose of this repository is  create a  a simple program that will answer medical questions by using the latest technologies of **IBM**.

The aim of this program is help people who require help.  This program does not replace a real doctor but help to identify the possible health solution.

The technologies which will use is **WatsonX** of **IBM** and **Watson Assistant.**

**Watsonx.ai** is part of the IBM watsonx platform that brings together new generative AI capabilities, powered by foundation models, and traditional machine learning into a powerful studio spanning the AI lifecycle. With watsonx.ai, you can train, validate, tune, and deploy generative AI, foundation models, and machine learning capabilities with ease and build AI applications in a fraction of the time with a fraction of the data.

We are going to use  **Foundation Models**  and test different models such as:

- **flan-ul2-20b**  - It is an encoder decoder model based on the T5 architecture and instruction-tuned using the Fine-tuned LAnguage Net.Model by Google
- **mt0-xxl-13b**  - An instruction-tuned iteration on mT5.Model by BigScience
- **gpt-neox-20b** - A 20 billion parameter autoregressive language model trained on the Pile.Model by EleutherAI
- **flan-t5-xxl-11b**  - It is an 11 billion parameter model based on the Flan-T5 family.Model by Google
- **mpt-7b-instruct**  - It is a decoder-style transformer pretrained from scratch on 1T tokens of English text and code. 

The structure of the program contains 5 parts.

1. [**Environment creation**](./1-Environment/README.md)

   Here we are going to create the environment to create the models locally that later can be used

2. [**Creation of the Medical Dataset.**](./2-Data/README.md)

   In this part we are going to build the Datasets that will be used create the **Medical Model**

3. [**Creation of the model by using RAG**](./3-Modeling/README.md)
   In this part we will perform feature engineering and create the model

4. [**Finetuning Models for the Medical Chatbot**](./6-FineTunning/README.md)
   We create a custom model based on medical information


5. [**Multimodal Medical Chatbot**](./7-Multimodal/README.md)
   We develop a medical chatbot multimodal, that from images can give you a description of the issue. We analazize different Medical Images Datasets.


## Chatbot with WatsonX

**Implementation of a chatbot with WatsonX in production.**

Here we will create a chatbot with the capability to answer questions by using the Model created before.
For Production in WatsonX you can checkout this repo

## Chatbot with Custom LLM 
We have also developed another version which uses a custom LLM

## Fine-tunning Models with ai-medical chatbot

Currently there are two base models that were pretrained with ai-medical-chatbot

## Meta Llama 3
This repository provides a fine-tuned version of the powerful Llama3 8B model, specifically designed to answer medical questions in an informative way. It leverages the rich knowledge contained in the AI Medical Chatbot dataset.




[Medical-Llama3-8B](https://huggingface.co/ruslanmv/Medical-Llama3-8B)

The latest version of the Medical Llama 2 v2 with an improved Chatbot Interface in Google Colab


[Medical-Llama3-v2](https://huggingface.co/ruslanmv/Medical-Llama3-v2)



## Mixtral-7B
Fine-tuned Mixtral model for answering medical assistance questions. This model is a novel version of mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, adapted to a subset of 2.0k records from the AI Medical Chatbot dataset, which contains 250k records . The purpose of this model is to provide a ready chatbot to answer questions related to medical assistance.
